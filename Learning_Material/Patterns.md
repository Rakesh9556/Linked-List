## Intuition
- most pattern is printed using nested loops

- Rule 1: in outer loop count the no. of lines
- Rule 2: in inner loop, focus on columns and connect them somehow to the rows
- Rule 3: print inside the inner loop
- Rule $: observe symmetry (optional)


### Square Pattern

``` cpp
void printSquare(int n) {
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {
            cout << "* ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
